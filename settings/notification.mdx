## ✅ What Each Option Does

- **Notify all Conversion (toggle ON)**  
  - Sends an email for **every conversion**.  
  - When ON, the **pages exceeded** setting is ignored.

- **Notify when pages exceeded (number)**  
  - Works only when **Notify all Conversion is OFF**.  
  - Sends an email **only if** the uploaded file’s page count is **greater than** the number you set.  
  - Example: If you set the value to `4`, an email is sent when a file has **5 or more pages**.
