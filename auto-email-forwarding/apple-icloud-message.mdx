You can automatically forward all incoming emails from your **iCloud Mail** account to another email address. This guide shows you how to do it step by step.

## Forward All Emails Automatically

1. **Open iCloud Mail** in your web browser and sign in to your account.  
2. In the **Mailboxes** list, click the **Settings** icon (⚙️) to open **Preferences**.  
3. Go to the **General** tab.  
4. Locate the **Forward my email to** option and enter the email address where you want your emails forwarded.  
5. Decide whether to **keep a copy of forwarded emails** in iCloud:  
   - Leave it unchecked to delete emails after forwarding.  
   - Keep it checked if you want copies in your iCloud account (note: storing copies uses your iCloud storage).  
6. Click **Done** to save your settings.  

> From now on, all incoming emails will automatically be forwarded to the address you specified.

## Forward Only Specific Emails

If you don’t want to forward all messages, you can create a **filter**:  

1. Set up rules in iCloud Mail to forward only certain emails based on sender, subject, or other criteria.
