# 🧠 Understanding OCR Processing

**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is a technology that converts scanned documents and images into editable and searchable data.  

In **Bank Statement Converter**, OCR works together with AI to extract bank statement data efficiently:

- **Text Recognition**  
  OCR identifies and extracts text from PDFs and scanned images.  

- **Data Structuring**  
  Extracted data is organized into tables and structured formats like **Excel, CSV, or Google Sheets**.  

- **Accuracy Enhancement**  
  Post-processing by our AI model improves the accuracy of OCR results, ensuring clean and usable data.

> 🔍 Note: OCR accuracy depends on the quality and clarity of the input document.
