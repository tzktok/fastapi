## ðŸ“Š Exporting Data to Google Sheets

The information you receive from order confirmations, booking emails, or website forms often needs to be organized into financial statements or reports.  
Instead of doing this manually, **BankStatementConverter** lets you **automatically export your parsed data to Google Sheets**, making it faster and easier to keep your records up to date.

# Using a Special Google Sheets Formula

After creating your **Mailbox** you can bring parsed data into Google Sheets by copying the **special formula** (available on the **Integrations** page) and pasting it into any cell in your Sheet.

  className="rounded-lg"
/>

- Google Sheets will refresh the data automatically approximately **once every hour**.  
- To update the data immediately, delete the formula from the cell and then use **Undo** â€” this will force a refresh.  
- You can also **customize the order of your data columns** at any time from the **Fields** page.  

Once the inbox and auto-forwarding rules are set, you can pull your parsed data into Google Sheets quickly using this formula.
