# Send Data to a Webhook

If you want to send your parsed data to your server, another app, or a platform that isn’t directly integrated with google sheets, or similar tools, the easiest way is to use a **webhook**. A webhook allows you to transfer data from one application to another in **real-time**, making it a more practical solution than traditional APIs.

## Steps to Export Your Parsed Data via Webhook

**Step 1:** Copy the endpoint URL from the application where you want to send the data.  

**Step 2:** In your [Bank Statement Converter](https://bankstmtconverter.com/) account, go to **Integrations → Webhooks**.

**Step 3:** Click on **“Create a webhook”**, select a trigger (typically **“Document parsed”**), and paste the destination URL.  
![destinationurl](/images/webhookdestinationurl.png)

From this point onward, BankStatementConverter will trigger the webhook every time the selected event occurs.  

You can also use services like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to generate a test webhook endpoint and view the received payload data in real-time.  

## Configuring Your Server to Receive Payloads

If you want to receive webhook events on your own server, you can use the following code samples to handle the payload data effectively.


#### php
```Php
$payload = @file_get_contents('php://input');
// ...
http_response_code(200);
```


#### go
```go
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/webhook", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Read raw request body
        payload, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Failed to read body", http.StatusInternalServerError)
            return
        }
        defer r.Body.Close()

        // ... do something with payload
        _ = payload // just like PHP comment placeholder

        // Send 200 OK response
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    })

    // Start server on port 4242
    http.ListenAndServe(":4242", nil)
}
```

#### Python
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    payload = request.data
    # ...
    return jsonify(success=True)

```

#### NodeJs
```JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.raw({type: 'application/json'}), (request, response) => {
  const payload = request.body;
  // ...
  response.send();
});

app.listen(4242, () => console.log('Running on port 4242'));
```

# Secure Your Webhooks (Optional)

To receive webhooks, you need a **publicly accessible URL** (the webhook endpoint).  
Be aware that this can be insecure, as anyone who knows the URL could trigger actions on your server.

Bankstatementconverter provides a **unique Signing Secret** for each webhook. Every webhook payload is signed using this secret, and the signature is sent in the request header `Bankstatementconverter-signature`.  

Verifying this signature ensures that the request is genuine and truly sent from Bankstatementconverter.

## How to Verify the Signature

1. Use your **Signing Secret** to generate a signature for the received payload.
2. Compare your generated signature with the `Bankstatementconverter-signature` header sent with the webhook.
3. If both signatures match, the request is authentic and safe to process.

![signingsecretkey](/images/webhooksigningkey.png)

⚠️ Note: A Signing Secret is valid for 30 minutes. After that, requests signed with the expired key will fail verification.

#### Steps to Verify the Signature

- Generate a hash of the entire received payload using the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm with your Signing Secret as    the key.

- Convert this hash into Base64 format.

- Compare your generated signature with the value received in the Bankstatementconverter-signature header.

- If both values match, the webhook is verified.

| Field Name    | Value from your event              | Meaning                                                                                   |

| `event`       | `"document.extracted"`             | The core action: The document has been successfully processed and its content/metadata is now available. This triggers your system to act. |
| `document_id` | `"01k6mabs1npmhaedy6yf1c9hmc"`     | A unique identifier for this specific document. Use this ID to fetch the extracted data (text, tables, etc.). |
| `name`        | `"Pixalto-Pricing (1).pdf"`        | The original filename of the document.                                                     |
